Our Problem Statement of CFI Hack:

A significant portion of cycle rickshaw pullersâ€™ working hours are spent searching or waiting for passengers. On the other hand, passengers are also seen searching for rickshaws. The demand-supply mismatch differs across locations, with concentration of cycle rickshaws in high traffic zones, and passengers in interior lanes having to walk.
